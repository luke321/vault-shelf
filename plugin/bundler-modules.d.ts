// The two import prefixes scripts/build-plugin.mjs resolves, described to the type program.
//
// `raw:` inlines a file as text and `b64:` as base64 -- both are esbuild namespace loaders of
// our own (see the plugin in that script), so no typing anywhere knows them, and without this
// file an `import PAGE_HTML from "raw:..."` is an unresolved module: an error type that every
// use of the value then carries onto the no-unsafe meter. A declaration file, not a cast at
// the use site: typescript-eslint reads the type of the expression inside a JSDoc cast, not
// the cast, so `/** @type {string} */ (PAGE_HTML)` changes nothing there.
//
// Not a compile step, and nothing bundles or ships it: esbuild follows imports and this is
// imported by nothing. tsconfig.json names it so the program has it.
