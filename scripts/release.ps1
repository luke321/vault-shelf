.SYNOPSIS
  The local half of a release: check, gate, tag, push. The publishing half is
  .github/workflows/release.yml, which the tag push triggers.

.DESCRIPTION
  Refuses a v-prefixed or non-semver version, a version the manifest does not claim, a
  version with no CHANGELOG section, a branch other than main, a dirty tree and a main behind
  origin; prints the hero and feature-clip warnings; runs lint and the invariant suite; builds
  the plugin once as a pre-flight; then writes the annotated tag and pushes the branch and the
  tag. Everything after that -- build, provenance attestation, Release, assets -- is the
  workflow's. .ai-context/releasing.md is the authority on the two halves.

.PARAMETER Version
  Bare semver, e.g. 2.0.0. No v.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Stop after the suite, before the tag and the push.

.PARAMETER AllowDirty
  Tag a dirty tree anyway.

.PARAMETER AllowAnyBranch
  Tag off main anyway; the workflow's main-ancestry guard will then refuse to publish.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release.ps1 2.0.0 -DryRun

param(
  [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)][string] $Version,
  # -Notes AND -Title ARE GONE, and their jobs did not disappear -- they moved.
  #
  # -Notes prepended a one-line summary to the release body. The body is now drafted by
  # the workflow from the `## <version>` CHANGELOG section -- the same text this script
  # writes into the tag message, so `git show <tag>` and the Release page still agree --
  # and then rewritten by hand: a highlight reel on top, the CHANGELOG section verbatim
  # underneath. See .ai-context/releasing.md for that shape. A one-liner passed at tag
  # time has nowhere useful to land in it.
  #
  # -Title named the release ("1.8.0 - The Hub"). The workflow reads that name out of the
  # CHANGELOG heading instead -- `## 1.9.0 -- "Belonging" -- 2026-09-02` -- so the title
  # and the changelog section it sits above can no longer disagree, which a hand-typed
  # argument allowed. The ASCII-hyphen decision survives in the workflow: the original
  # reason was that PowerShell 5.1 re-encodes a native command-line argument on the way
  # out and this repo published mojibake that way once, and although a UTF-8 runner has no
  # such problem, every published title uses a hyphen and a title cannot be quietly fixed
  # after it has been seen.

  # hatch for the branch guard below, shaped like -AllowDirty: there is a legitimate case

  # not to make the deliberate thing impossible.

# progress on stderr, so a SUCCESSFUL push killed this script half-way through its first
# real run -- after the push had landed, before the release was created. Native calls go
# through here: stderr stays visible, and the exit code is what decides.
# Arguments as an explicit ARRAY, not ValueFromRemainingArguments: a parameter cannot be
# called $Args -- that is an automatic variable -- and binding silently broke, so
# `Invoke-Native git tag -a ...` came back as "no positional parameter accepts 'tag'".
